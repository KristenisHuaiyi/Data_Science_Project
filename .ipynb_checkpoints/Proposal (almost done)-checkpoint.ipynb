    "Our main focus of this project is to determine which factors have a significant contribution towards heart failure. The data we obtained consists of factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, age, sex, whether someone smokes, and so on. Our goal is to use these factors as predictors to predict if someone should receive medical attention immediately or not. If predictions indicates death, it would suggest doctors to focus on this case immediately to prevent death, and if it indicates they are going to survive, then we would do precautions to prevent them from falling into the categories that might lead them to death.
